 main.tf

provider "aws" {
 region = "us-east-2"
}

syntax for creating a resource in Terraform is:
resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
 [CONFIG ...]
}

run terraform init (idempotent cmd) to tell Terraform to scan the code, figure out which providers you’re using, and download the code for them.
By default, the provider code will be downloaded into a .terraform folder, which is Terraform’s scratch directory (you may want to
add it to .gitignore). 
Terraform will also record information about the provider code it downloaded into a .terraform.lock.hcl file

terraform plan command lets you see what Terraform will do before actually making any changes. This is a great way to sanity check your code
anything with a plus sign (+) will be created, anything with a minus sign (–) will be deleted, and anything with a tilde sign (~) will be modified in place

git add main.tf .terraform.lock.hcl
git commit -m "Initial commit"
You should also create a .gitignore file with the following contents:
.terraform
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add a .gitignore file
